# Chapter 5 — Conditionals

Programs get interesting when they make choices. Forge does that with **If** and
**Otherwise**.

Open the **weather** note and **Forge** (🔥) it:

```
It's pleasant.
```

## What's new

Open the note and look. It sets a value, `temperature`, to `72`, and then
makes a choice:

- **If** `temperature is greater than 80`, it returns "It's hot."
- **Otherwise**, it returns "It's pleasant."

Each choice's lines are **indented** underneath it — that's how Forge knows which
lines belong to the `If` and which belong to the `Otherwise`. Since `72` is not
greater than `80`, Forge skips the first block and runs the `Otherwise` one — so
you get "It's pleasant." Whichever branch runs, its `Return` hands that string
back as the note's result.

`is greater than` is one of several comparisons you can use — there's also
`is less than`, `is at least`, `is at most`, `equals`, and `does not equal`.

> The **If** and **Otherwise** chips are now in your 🔥 palette.

## Exercise

Open the **weather** note, change `72` to `95`, and Forge again. Now the
condition is true, so you'll see "It's hot." Try a few values right around `80`
to find the dividing line.

## Palette focus

Focus on **If** and **Otherwise** for this chapter. The `If ... , ... Otherwise
...` construct is Forge's branching. Ignore `For each` for now — that's
[[Loops]].

When you're ready, go to [[Loops]] — where notes repeat themselves.
