  wheels hadn't been mounted into pyodide yet), retry the import here
  at call time. Driver smoke v0.2.169: murmuration crashed inside a

  because pyodide's wheel mount happens AFTER executor.py's top-level
  try/except already cached an empty bundle.

  v0.3.x (post-v0.2.176) — two perf-critical guards on the retry path,
  surfaced when the moda V2 simulation Forge-clicked from bluh vault
  triggered "music-domain lazy hydration FAILED — No module named
  'music21'" on EVERY chip call (hundreds of failed imports per
  per-tick simulation step → tons of stderr trace output → multi-
  second click→ink lag):
  1. Only attempt music hydration when `"music"` is in active domains
     (skip entirely for moda-only or tutorial-only vaults — music21
     wheels are huge and probing when the vault never needs music
     is pure waste).
  2. Cache the stderr LOG (not the attempt) per domain. v0.2.177 also
     cached the attempt itself, but that turned out too aggressive:
     bluh vault's simulation hit a wheel-mount race where music21
     wasn't ready yet on the first chip call, the failure cached, and
     a subsequent Forge-click on murmuration (run minutes later, after
     wheels had mounted) silently used the empty music chip dict →
     `NameError: play_at_offsets is not defined`. v0.2.178 reverts
     the attempt-cache and keeps only the log-cache: every call re-
     attempts the import (so wheel-mount races resolve on their own),

    Semantics (constitution C8 + the option-(A) limitation). Forge
    captures snapshots per *edge* (caller -> callee), keyed by the
    callee. Entry-point snippets such as moda `go` are never a callee
    — nothing calls `context.compute("go")` — so a "snapshot of go as
    seen by a caller" is never written. What IS persisted is go's own
    *outbound* edge directory `.forge/edges/<self_id>/`, holding one
    snapshot per snippet `go` called. This returns the latest of
    those. For a pass-through snippet whose return value equals its
    terminal callee's return (moda `go`), that is exactly "go's last
    output". For a snippet that post-processes state before returning,
    it would be the last sub-call's output and would lag the true
    return by that post-processing — a known, bounded limitation the
    snippet's English facet MUST declare (C8).

    Independent of freeze (F1-F9): reads the stored snapshot whatever
    the edge state.

    `captured_at` has 1-second resolution, so several snapshots written
    inside one invocation tie. Ties break by file mtime (last write

  reads `facet_form`; the field is inert. The engine tries E--
  transpile for every action snippet with an `# English` heading
  and returns None when transpile fails (E-- syntax error OR no
  English heading). The plugin's

  See docs/specs/constitution.md B7.3 + the v0.2.121 feedback for
  the migration rationale.

  Cache invalidation runs through `english_hash` in frontmatter
  per B7.3:

    - In `english` mode (default), the engine reads `english_hash`
      from frontmatter and compares it to compute_english_hash() of
      the current `# English` section. Match → return cached Python.
      Mismatch → re-transpile (which may re-raise SlotCacheMissError
      if slots are present and unresolved).
    - In `python` mode, the user has explicitly taken over `# Python`;
      the engine uses it directly without hash check.

  `slot_resolutions` (v0.2.72): when None, the resolver collects
  missing slots and raises SlotCacheMissError (first pass). When
  provided as `dict[cache_key, python_expr]`, the resolver looks up
  every slot in the dict; missing entries still raise.

  Returns:
    - `extract_python(body)` result when a `# Python` heading is
      present AND either `edit_mode: python` (override) OR
      english_hash matches (cache hit).
    - E-- transpile output when transpile succeeds (slot-resolved).
    - None when E-- can't compile (syntax error) OR no English

  resolve to the qualified target — caller's own dir first, then
  sibling subdirs, then A4 vault walk.

  Motivating use case: E--'s emitter emits bare Python calls (e.g.,

  via Python's normal name lookup in the exec namespace, which only
  has `__builtins__` + a few domain modules. snippet-to-snippet
  composition would raise NameError. With shims, `greet(name)`
  dispatches via context.compute and the call graph traverses
  correctly.

  Skips bare_ids whose basename isn't a valid Python identifier
  (e.g., basenames containing `-` or starting with a digit) — those
  can't appear as bare Python references anyway, so no shim is
