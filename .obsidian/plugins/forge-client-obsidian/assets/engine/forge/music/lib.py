These functions are pre-injected into the snippet namespace by the executor

    - Returns `list[str]` of `nameWithOctave` strings — e.g.
      `["C4", "D4", "E4", "F4", "G4", "A4", "B4", "C5"]` for
      `diatonic_scale("C", "major")`.
    - `octave_range=[low, high]` inclusive: e.g. `[4, 5]` spans one
      octave (tonic4 ascending through tonic5); `[3, 5]` spans two
      octaves. Defaults to `[4, 5]`.
    - `mode` accepts `"major"` (default) or `"minor"` (natural minor).
    - `tonic` is a pitch-class string: `"C"`, `"F#"`, `"B-"` (music21
      flat convention). Bare `"Bb"` is also accepted by music21.
    - Accidentals in the return value follow music21's convention
      verbatim: flats as `-` (e.g. `"B-4"`), sharps as `#`.

  Companion to `major_scale` (which returns 7 pitch-class names, no
  octaves) and `major_pentatonic` / `minor_pentatonic` (which return
  5-note `pitch.Pitch` lists). Use `diatonic_scale` when you want
  7-note diatonic coverage with octave-anchored pitch names — the
  common building block for scale runs, arpeggio starting points,
  and melodic-line sketches.

  Musical correctness reference: `music21.scale.MajorScale` /
  `music21.scale.MinorScale`. Thin adapter — no hand-rolled interval
  math; follows whatever music21 says the scale is.

# a music21 Part whose MIDI export lands at the correct channel-10
# drum slot (kick=35, snare=38, etc.) without relying on the
# serialization.py percMapPitch normalization downstream.

  """Build a music21 Part with one quarter-note hit per beat position.
  `beats` is 1-INDEXED (beat 1 = first beat of the bar = offset 0.0;
  there is no beat 0). For 0-indexed positions, multi-bar patterns,
  or non-quarter-note durations, use [[play_at_offsets]] instead.

  Args:
    instrument: a music21 Instrument (typically from one of the percussion
      factories above — kick(), snare(), closed_hihat(), etc.). When
      the instrument has a `percMapPitch` attribute, every note's
      pitch.midi is set to that value so streamToMidiFile emits the
      correct drum slot on channel 10 (per the v0.2.159 lesson: music21
      uses each NOTE's spelled pitch, not the Part instrument's
      percMapPitch). For non-percussion instruments without percMapPitch,
      notes default to C4 (spec doesn't pin this; cohort can override
      via more specialized chips in V2.1).
    beats: a list of beat positions, 1-indexed (beat 1 = first beat of
      the bar = offset 0.0). Floats are supported for sub-beat
      positions ([1, 1.5, 2, 2.5] is straight eighths). An empty list
      returns a Part with just the instrument attached.

      For explicit subdivision control (16th notes, dotted patterns,
      triplets, multi-bar patterns), use [[play_at_offsets]] with 0-
      indexed offsets and a matching `duration`. Example: 16th-note
      hihat groove is `Call [[play_at_offsets]] with instrument=
      [[closed_hihat]], offsets=[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5,
      1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75], duration=0.25`.
      This chip's `beats` convention is quarter-note grid only.

  Returns:
    music21.stream.Part with the instrument inserted at offset 0 and
    one quarterLength=1 Note per beat position. Note pitch normalized

  Raises:

      Pre-v0.2.200 the catalog's first-paragraph introspection didn't
      surface the 1-indexed convention, and the LLM happily generated
      `beats=[0]` (programmer-natural 0-index). That produced

  Drain 2026-07-10-1340 phase 2 (D-note-1). Deterministic per the

  - **style**: `"rootless"` (default, 4 pitches — 3-5-7-9 extensions
    where available; falls back to 3-5-7 built from the chord root
    when the input is a plain triad), `"stride"` (5 pitches — root +
    fifth in the left hand octave-below plus root/3/5 in the right
    hand), `"block"` (4 pitches — four-way close: root, 3rd, 5th,
    b7). The 7th/9th used for rootless/block are computed from the
    chord root (major 3rd, perfect 5th, minor 7th (blues idiom),
    9th) rather than read from the input chord, which is typically a
    plain triad from `form()`.
  - **register**: `"low"` (C2-C4), `"mid"` (default, C3-C5), or
    `"high"` (C4-C6). Every pitch in every voicing is transposed by
    octaves to fit within the register.
  - **rhythm**: `"charleston"` (default) — chord on beat 1
    (dotted-quarter) + chord on beat 3 (dotted-quarter). In 4/4
    (bar_ql=4): 1.5 + 0.5 + 2.0 (dotted-quarter, eighth, half — the
    classic charleston figure). In 12/8 (bar_ql=6): 1.5 + rest 1.5 +
    1.5 + rest 1.5 (two dotted-quarter hits on beats 1 and 3).
    `"straight_quarters"` — 4 chord hits per bar at bar_ql/4.
    `"eighth_comping"` — 8 hits (or 12 in 12/8) at bar_ql/8 (or
    bar_ql/12).

  Instrument: `music21.instrument.Piano`.

  """Vocal melody with lyrics over a 12-bar harmonic form.

  Drain 2026-07-10-1340 phase 4 (D-note-4). Deterministic per pinned
  design decisions:

  - **voice_type**: `"soprano"` (C4-C6), `"alto"` (default, G3-G5),
    `"tenor"` (C3-C5), or `"baritone"` (F2-F4). Each pitch is
    octave-fit to the voice's register bounds.

    Instrument: attempt `music21.instrument.<VoiceType>` (Soprano /
    Alto / Tenor / Baritone all exist in current music21). If the
    class is not present, fall back to `music21.instrument.Vocalist`.
  - **lyrics**: `""` (default) → no Lyric annotations (blank vocals /
    hum). Non-empty → split on whitespace; one word per note. If
    there are fewer words than notes, remaining notes get no lyric;
    if more, extra words are dropped (spread evenly by index).
    Slot resolution is a transpiler-layer concern; the chip only
    handles literal strings.
  - **form**: `"AAB"` only (v1). Raises ValueError for others. Splits
    the 12 measures into 4 + 4 + 4. Phrase A: chord-tone walker
    (root, third, fifth, next-root approach). Phrase A': same shape
    with the last note swapped for a small variation. Phrase B:
    resolve to tonic — the very final note is placed at the key's
    tonic (in the voice's register).
  - **style**: `"blues"` only (v1); accepted for API stability but
    doesn't currently alter behaviour.

  Args:
    harmony: `stream.Score` or `stream.Part` from `form(...)` — must
      have exactly 12 measures.
    voice_type: `"soprano"` | `"alto"` | `"tenor"` | `"baritone"`.
    lyrics: literal whitespace-separated words, or `""` for blanks.
    form: `"AAB"` only.
    style: `"blues"` only.

  Returns:
    A `stream.Part` with 12 Measures, four notes each.
